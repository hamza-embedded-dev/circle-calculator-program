# Day 3: Basic Circle Calculator

My third day of learning C. I wrote this simple program to practice how to use the `math.h` library and handle user input.

### What it does:
The program takes a radius value from the user and calculates:

Area of a circle
Circumference of a circle
Surface area of a sphere
Volume of a sphere

### How I built it:
Used `double` for precision.
Added a basic `if` check to prevent negative radius inputs.
Used `pow()` for calculations.
**Note for Linux users:** Compile with `-lm` to link the math library.
